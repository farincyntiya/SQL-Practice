# SQL Practices

Special thanks to [Data with Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/) for the SQL case studies! ✨

I used [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to solve the case studies 💻

The SQL challenge can be found on the website **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**

Danny's Diner SQL Case Study can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)

### The Case:
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so, at the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
Danny’s Diner is in need of assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but has no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

Pizza Runner SQL Case Study can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/)

### The Case:
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”
Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!
Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
